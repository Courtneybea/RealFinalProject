        <h3>Who Is Snoop Dogg?</h3> <br>
        Snoop Dogg, born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. on October 20, 1971, is an iconic American rapper, actor, and
        entrepreneur. Rising to fame in the early 1990s with his distinctive laid-back delivery and affiliation with Dr.
        Dre, Snoop became a central figure in the West Coast hip-hop scene. His debut album, Doggystyle (1993), cemented
        his place in music history, featuring hits like "Gin and Juice." Over the years, Snoop Dogg has evolved into a
        global pop culture icon, branching out into acting, producing, cooking shows with Martha Stewart, and even
        esports. His humor and charisma make him universally relatable, transcending generational and cultural
        boundaries.

        <h3>The Origins of Snoop on the Stoop</h3><br>
        Snoop on the Stoop is a playful and festive twist on the popular Elf on the Shelf tradition. Drawing inspiration
        from Snoop Dogg's larger-than-life personality, this novelty item replaces the traditional elf with a miniature
        figurine of Snoop himself, often styled in a Santa suit or festive attire. The idea blends the cheer of the
        holidays with the relaxed, fun-loving vibe associated with Snoop Dogg. It has gained traction in recent years as
        a quirky alternative to mainstream Christmas decorations, appealing to fans of hip-hop and pop culture alike.
